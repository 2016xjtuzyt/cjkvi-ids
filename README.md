IDS data
========

This is a collection of various IDS data.

## Description

* Compatibility ideographs whose IDS is not equal to corresponding
  unified ideographs may be used as DC.

## Encoding Policies

* Following non-ideographs may be used as DCs (for now).
  "αℓ△⺀⺄⺆⺈⺊⺌⺍⺶⺸⺻⺼〇〢キサ㇀㇉㇢"

* Encircled numerics ① ～ ⑳ represents unencoded DCs. Number denotes
  its stroke count. This would be useful when calculating total
  strokes of ideographs.

* '&CDP-XXXX;' notation (Chinese Document Processing Lab) is derived
  from CHISE project. For details of useable glyph, refer
  [CDP article](http://glyphwiki.org/wiki/Group:CDP%E5%A4%96%E5%AD%97)
  of GlyphWiki. They can be converted to Unicode PUAs by using
  Microsoft Big5 conversion table.

* Compatibility charactes whose IDS is not equal to its corresponding
  unified ideographs may be used as DCs.

* IDS of compatibility ideographs may sometimes have compatible
  ideographs as DCs by mean of clarifying the difference of its
  structure compared with corresponding unified ideograph.
